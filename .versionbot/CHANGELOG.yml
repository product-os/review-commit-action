      body: |
        This makes it less likely that a malicious change would
        be buried in an earlier commit, and missed when only
        reviewing the tip of HEAD.

    - subject: Throw if top-level repo name does not match PR base context
      hash: 820932c55973b8659756a9911bde0d50f8beb651
      body: |
        It is unclear from the docs whether the top level context.repo
        property will always reflect the target/base of a PR from a fork,
        or the forked repo.

        So to be safe until we can test all scenarios, throw an exception
        if the values do not match.
