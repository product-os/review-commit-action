    - subject: Replace commit comments with a single runtime PR comment
      hash: 6dfec5891bfea3b299f8b6b1a448d67829aec3cb
      body: |
        Avoid the added complexity of matching existing commit comments
        and just track a single PR comment for the run of the workflow.

        A new PR comment is created on every run and will be polled for
        eligible reactions. For now stale PR comments are not removed.

    - subject: Remove timeout input and use workflow step timeout-minutes directive
      hash: 0d49d255eac16f6c41976cb23ccceaf2bf6db17d
      body: |
        The actions workflow syntax already includes an option
        to set a timeout on a specific step, so we can remove the input to
        simplify the action.

      hash: c16bf030cc86497a9ad40cdde28c62baafffc56e
      body: |
        This makes it less likely that a malicious change would
        be buried in an earlier commit, and missed when only
        reviewing the tip of HEAD.

    - subject: Throw if top-level repo name does not match PR base context
      hash: 820932c55973b8659756a9911bde0d50f8beb651
      body: |
        It is unclear from the docs whether the top level context.repo
        property will always reflect the target/base of a PR from a fork,
        or the forked repo.

        So to be safe until we can test all scenarios, throw an exception
        if the values do not match.
