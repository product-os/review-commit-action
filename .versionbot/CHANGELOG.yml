      hash: 162bacd905829fbb3cf324a7c052d5018eca0e80
      body: |
        This could result in removing reactions from
        a user that provided a PAT to the action.

        Instead, just allow posting multiple reactions
        for UX.

      hash: a7fbe304fd84c4d08a7ea9fdc698cd26a3e6e3ab
      body: |
        This is to support cases where users want or need
        to use this action with a PAT or fine-grained token
        that is associated with a user account.

        Preventing the token identity from reviewing
        commits means the PAT owner cannot review, which
        is a fairly common use case outside of organizations.

        Avoid the added complexity of matching existing commit comments
        and just track a single PR comment for the run of the workflow.

        A new PR comment is created on every run and will be polled for
        eligible reactions. For now stale PR comments are not removed.

      body: |
        It is unclear from the docs whether the top level context.repo
        property will always reflect the target/base of a PR from a fork,
        or the forked repo.

        So to be safe until we can test all scenarios, throw an exception
        if the values do not match.
