# Approved Commit Action

This GitHub Action waits for approval from a repository maintainer via a reaction on a commit comment.
It's designed to be used in pull request workflows where you need manual approval before proceeding with certain actions.

## Features

- Creates a commit comment on the tip of HEAD in pull request workflows
- Waits for a reaction from a collaborator with write access to the repository
- Supports custom reactions for approval and denial

## Usage

To use this action in your workflow, add the following step:

```yaml
- name: Wait for Approval
  uses: balena-io-experimental/review-commit-action@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    approve-reaction: '+1'
    reject-reaction: '-1'
    check-interval: '10'
```

### Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `github-token` | GitHub token for authentication | No | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `check-interval` | Interval in seconds between checks for reactions | No | `'10'` |

### Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `comment-id` | `ID of the commit comment` |
| `approved-by` | `Login of the user who approved the commit` |
| `rejected-by` | `Login of the user who rejected the commit` |

## Workflow

1. When triggered in a PR workflow, the action creates a commit comment on the tip of HEAD.
2. The comment requests that a repo maintainer react with the specified approval reaction (default: üëç) to approve the workflow.
3. The action then enters a loop, waiting for a reaction from someone with write access to the repository.
4. If the required reaction is not found, it will continue looping until the job times out.
5. If a denial reaction is received from someone with write access, the action will exit with an error.
