# Code Formatting Guidelines

## Prettier Configuration
- Always follow the prettier configuration defined in `.prettierrc.json`
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas where valid in ES5 (objects, arrays, etc.)
- Line length should not exceed 80 characters
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Break long function calls and object literals across multiple lines
- When breaking lines in function calls, put each argument on its own line with proper indentation

## JavaScript/Node.js Best Practices
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Prefer arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Always use strict equality (`===` and `!==`)
- Use async/await instead of Promise chains where possible

## Code Style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate error messages

## File Organization
- Keep related functionality together
- Use clear module exports and imports
- Separate concerns into different files/modules
- Follow the existing project structure
