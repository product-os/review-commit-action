# Testing Guidelines

## Jest Testing Conventions
- Follow Jest testing conventions
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks
- Use `beforeEach` for test setup
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Test Structure
- Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
- One assertion per test when possible
- Clear test descriptions that read like specifications
- Use meaningful variable names in tests

## Mocking Best Practices
- Mock external dependencies at the module level
- Clear all mocks in `beforeEach` or `afterEach`
- Use `jest.fn()` for function mocks
- Mock only what you need to test the specific behavior
