# GitHub Actions Guidelines

## Best Practices
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Use semantic and descriptive action names
- Properly handle errors and set appropriate exit codes
- Use core.info, core.warning, and core.error for logging

## Error Handling
- Always use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Set meaningful error messages with context
- Use `core.setFailed()` to mark the action as failed
- Log errors before throwing them

## Input/Output Management
- Validate all inputs at the start of the action
- Use `core.getInput()` and `core.getBooleanInput()` appropriately
- Set outputs using `core.setOutput()` with descriptive names
- Document all inputs and outputs in action.yml

## Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs
- Use least privilege permissions
- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Follow TOCTOU attack prevention patterns
